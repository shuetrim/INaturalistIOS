We have picked a time when tides are low in the early morning, when it will be easiest to spot the straight lines of penguin tracks, but consider the tides, the waves, the weather and even marine mammals (give seals plenty of space) as you go for your walk, and let someone know where you are going and when you'll be back.\r\nThe West Coast Penguin Trust's aim is to conserve the blue penguins, Fiordland crested penguins, other threatened seabirds and their habitat on the West Coast, and you can help through this project.\r\nYou can find out more about the Trust at http://www.bluepenguin.org.nz and more details about this project, including a guide to identifying penguin tracks. \r\nThank you, and have fun!

Your help is needed to protect our natural and productive environments. As citizen scientists one way to help is by mapping potential host plants and then monitoring them periodically for signs of the disease.\r\n\r\nThis project is linked to the Myrtle Rust Reporter phone app (shortly available for iPhone or Android) that can be used for observing common host plants that may be susceptible to myrtle rust and getting assistance from others to confirm your identifications. The app can then be used for reporting potential infestations of myrtle rust that should then be followed up with the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).\r\n\r\nWe would like you to find a dozen plants in your neighbourhood that are potential hosts of myrtle rust. You can map them using the app. We have chosen 6 of the most common host plant species and have fact sheets on each to assist you in their identification. If you are unsure of a plant you can submit an observation of it and the NatureWatchNZ community will help you identify it. There are many plants from the myrtle family and if you want to choose a different myrtle species just click on the ‘record a different myrtle’ button.\r\n\r\nOnce you have located these plants keep an eye on them. They are the sentinels in your neighbourhood. If you see something suspicious that might be myrtle rust then submit your observation of the symptoms via the app (ideally take a photo of the upper surface of the leaf and ensure you include at least one entire leaf so that the identity of the host species can be confirmed) and ring MPI immediately on 0800 80 99 66 to discuss your observation. \r\n\r\nSometimes it is hard to get a decent photo of small things but you can take useful photos with smart phones through a magnifying glass or hand lens, if you have one. There are also affordable clip-on macro lenses you can buy for smart phones if you're keen.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-06T22:51:02+00:00","title":"Myrtle Rust Reporter","banner_color":null,"project_observation_rules":[{"operand_id":51816,"id":19022,"operand_type":"Taxon","operator":"in_taxon?"},{"operand_id":199331,"id":19023,"operand_type":"Taxon","operator":"in_taxon?"},{"operand_id":6803,"id":19080,"operand_type":"Place","operator":"observed_in_place?"},{"operand_id":549208,"id":19821,"operand_type":"Taxon","operator":"in_taxon?"}],"site_features":[{"noteworthy":true,"site_id":3,"featured_at":"2018-10-19T21:35:07+00:00"}],"project_observation_fields":[{"observation_field":{"name_autocomplete":"Severity of infection","allowed_values":"No infection|< 10 leaves affected|Half of new leaves affected|Almost all new leaves affected|I don’t know","values_count":29,"users_count":10,"datatype":"text","name":"Severity of infection","description":"Please describe the level of infection that you have observed.

This runs from midnight on Saturday, 15th through to midnight on Sunday 23rd September. Find and record as many plants, animals and fungi in and around your yard and street or block as you can and iNaturalist NZ will identify them. \r\n\r\nWe are aggregating this information regionally so we can build a picture of the diversity around the country in the places people live, work and play.  Each day we'll prompt you to look in particular habitats around your home and neighbourhood, and to leave no log or stone unturned in search for creatures large and small.  We are especially interested in learning what is wild, and what is not, and what is native and what is not. Please make sure you tick the captive/cultivated box if your observation is planted or domesticated.\r\n\r\nJoin this project to get the prompts we'll send out over the next 9 days to remind you to view the natural world through various lenses to build an amazing inventory of all the species that live around you. You don’t need to do these observations on the days of the prompts, but it is just to remind you to cover off all the habitats during the course of the week. \r\n\r\nPlease note down the habitat of your species (e.g, lawn, vegetable garden, house wall, under log) in your observations’ Descriptions. Check each day for birds (you can still record them even if you can’t get a picture), and don’t forget the creepy crawlies and moulds. \r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about revealing your exact locations then you can choose to iNaturalist's “obscured” geoprivacy option to publicly obscure your location to 10 km.

You're welcome to join this project if you want to help us learn more about these pest plants and their biology and impacts. Note: these records are not just those species officially recognised as pest plants by Government agencies, but rather personal assessment and judgement by the observers from their experience - crowd sourced weed designation!\r\n\r\nFor lots of handy information on New Zealand weeds and their control, see <a href=\"http://www.weedbusters.org.nz\">Weedbusters</a> website.\r\n\r\nYou can identify weeds yourself using the handy, interactive <a href=\"http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/identification/plants/weeds-key\">key to New Zealand weeds</a>.\r\n\r\nAs we get lots of observations added, this will become both a useful tool for identifying weeds in your area, and a source of weed distribution information for monitoring their spread or control.","created_at":"2012-08-13T01:26:19+00:00","title":"Pest Plants (weeds) of NZ","banner_color":null,"project_observation_rules":[{"operand_id":47126,"id":18419,"operand_type":"Taxon","operator":"in_taxon?"},{"operand_id":48222,"id":18421,"operand_type":"Taxon","operator":"in_taxon?"},{"operand_id":94916,"id":18422,"operand_type":"Place","operator":"observed_in_place?"}],"site_features":[{"noteworthy":false,"site_id":3,"featured_at":"2018-10-19T21:03:40+00:00"}],"project_observation_fields":[],"updated_at":"2018-12-22T04:23:12+00:00","terms":"May include plants classed as pest plants in any NZ region; but also species that the observer views as a threat to production or indigenous habitats and species through competitive displacement.
